# Number Guessing Neural Network
 This program is an interactive and user-friendly application that harnesses the power of a simple neural network model to tackle the MNIST Digit data set. Its primary functionality lies in the ability to allow users to draw a number directly on the screen, providing an intuitive and engaging experience. Once the user completes their hand-drawn representation of a digit, the program employs its neural network model to make an educated guess on which number the drawing corresponds to.

# Requirements
- Python 3.6 or below
- Pygame
